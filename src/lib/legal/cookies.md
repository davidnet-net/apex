## 1. What Are Cookies and Local Storage

- **Cookies** are small text files stored by your browser that help a website function.  
- **Local storage** is a browser-based mechanism that allows data to persist on your device without being transmitted to the server unless required.  

Both are used **only for essential functionality and user preferences**, not for tracking or analytics.
